My python training project, branches:
  * pyqt: code solving exercises from "Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt" book
  * python-challenge: code solving python challenge riddles
  * python-google-exercises: code solving template exercises from [python google class](http://code.google.com/intl/en-US/edu/languages/google-python-class/) and solutions
  * sphinx-eclipse: This branch contains some "sphinxed" code tests and sphinx ready eclipse templates, some of them are very interesting code receipts (basically decorators). All this templates can be found on [Downloads](http://rdc-python.googlecode.com/files/eclipse_templates.tar.gz) section.

After adding sphinx-eclipse branch I'm planning include some wiki pages for sphinx quick reference guide and code receipts from eclipse templates.
